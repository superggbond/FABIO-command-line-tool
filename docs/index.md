## FABIO
![FABIO\_pipeline](FABIO_scheme.png)
FABIO is a TWAS fine-mapping method that relies on a probit model to directly relate multiple genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) to binary outcome in TWAS fine-mapping. Additionally, it jointly models all genes located on the same chromosome to account for the correlation among GReX arising from cis-SNP LD and expression correlation across genomic regions. Through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, it obtains the posterior inclusion probability (PIP) of having a non-zero effect for each gene, as a measure of evidence for the geneâ€™s association with the outcome trait.
