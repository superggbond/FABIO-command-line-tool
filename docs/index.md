## FABIO
FABIO is a novel TWAS fine-mapping method that relies on a probit model to directly relate multiple genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) to binary outcome in TWAS fine-mapping. Additionally, it jointly models all genes located on a chromosome to account for the correlation among GReX arising from cis-SNP LD and expression correlation across genomic regions.
