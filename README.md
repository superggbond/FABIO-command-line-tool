## Fine-mApping of causal genes for BInary Outcomes (FABIO)
![FABIO](FABIO_scheme.png)
FABIO is a TWAS fine-mapping method that relies on a probit model to directly relate multiple genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) to binary outcome in TWAS fine-mapping. Additionally, it jointly models all genes located on a chromosome to account for the correlation among GReX arising from cis-SNP LD and expression correlation across genomic regions.

## How to use FABIO

See [Tutorial](https://superggbond.github.io/FABIO/) for detailed documentation and examples.
